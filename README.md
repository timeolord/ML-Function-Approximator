# ML-Function-Approximator
In development.

A toy neural network generator, which will eventually attempt to estimate any function given to it. I plan to make a GUI where the user can adjust parameters of the neural net, where they can try different depths, neuron counts, activation functions, optimizers, etc. Currently just plots a user defined function and the neural net estimation.
